## Data Types

- Java is a statically typed language, which means that all variables must be declared with a data type before they can be used.
- There are two main categories of data types in Java: primitive data types and reference data types.
- Wrapper classes are provided for each primitive data type, allowing them to be treated as objects when needed.
- Specific classes like `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` are available for handling very large numbers and precise decimal values, respectively.

### Primitive

| Type    | Describe                 | Range              |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| byte    | 8-bit integer            | -128 to 127        |
| short   | 16-bit integer           | -32,768 to 32,767. |
| int     | 32-bit integer           | -2^31 to 2^31-1    |
| long    | 64-bit integer           | -2^63 to 2^63-1    |
| float   | 32-bit floating-point    |                    |
| double  | 64-bit floating-point    |                    |
| char    | 16-bit Unicode character |                    |
| boolean | true / false             |                    |

```java
boolean isValid = false;
int age = 20;
long onlineUsers = 3_000_000L; // or 3000000
float weight = 2.5f;
double balanceAmount = -2000.277d;
```

### Reference

```java
// The root class of the Java hierarchy. All classes inherit this
Object obj = new Object();

char letter = 'A';
Character ch = 'A'; // Wrapper class of char
String str = "Hello world!";
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
float[] amounts = new float[5]; // arr with length = 5

// (Integer|Long).MAX_VALUE
Integer iNumber = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

// (Float|Double)
// - NEGATIVE|POSITIVE_INFINITY
// - MIN_VALUE: The smallest positive value greater than zero that can be represented in a float|double variable.
// - MAX_VALUE: The largest positive value that can be represented in a float|double variable.
// - NaN: not a number of type
Float fNumber = Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
```
