## Blocks

```java
public class Demo {
    private Integer number;

    // constructor
    public Demo() {}

    // Non-static block statement
    // Executed every Demo is created
    {
        System.out.println("Non-static block executed")
    }

    // Executed once when the class is loaded by JVM
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block executed")
    }
}
```
