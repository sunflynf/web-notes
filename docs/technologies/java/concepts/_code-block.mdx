## Blocks

```java
public class Demo {
    private Integer number;

    // constructor
    public Demo() {}

    {
        // Non-static block statement
        // Executed every Demo is created
        System.out.println("Non-static block executed")
    }

    static {
        // Executed once when the class is loaded by JVM
        System.out.println("Static block executed")
    }
}
```
