## Stream

- [**Stream API**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stream-in-java/) is used to process collections of objects
- **Features**
  - A stream is **not a data structure** instead it takes input from the [Collections](#collection), [Arrays](#arrays) or I/O channels.
  - Streams **donâ€™t change the original data structure**, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
  - Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
