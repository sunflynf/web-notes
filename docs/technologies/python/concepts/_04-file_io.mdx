## File I/O

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("test.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

# Reading from a file
with open("test.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### File Modes

- `"r"`: Read (default mode, file must exist)
- `"w"`: Write (creates a new file or truncates existing file)
- `"a"`: Append (creates a new file or appends to existing file)
- `"b"`: Binary mode (e.g., `"rb"` or `"wb"`)
- `"t"`: Text mode (default mode, e.g., `"rt"` or `"wt"`)

### Working with File Paths

```python
import os
# Get current working directory
cwd = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current Working Directory: {cwd}")

# Join paths
file_path = os.path.join(cwd, "test.txt")
print(f"File Path: {file_path}")

# Check if file exists
exists = os.path.exists(file_path)
print(f"File exists: {exists}")

# Get file size
size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
print(f"File size: {size} bytes")
```

### Handling Large Files

```python
# Reading large files line by line
with open("large_file.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        process(line)  # Replace with actual processing logic

# Writing large files in chunks
with open("large_output.txt", "w") as file:
    for chunk in generate_large_data():  # Replace with actual data generation logic
        file.write(chunk)
```

### CSV File Handling

```python
import csv
# Writing to a CSV file
with open("data.csv", "w", newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "City"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 30, "New York"])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 25, "Los Angeles"])

# Reading from a CSV file
with open("data.csv", "r") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

### JSON File Handling

```python
import json
# Writing to a JSON file
data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
with open("data.json", "w") as jsonfile:
    json.dump(data, jsonfile)

# Reading from a JSON file
with open("data.json", "r") as jsonfile:
    data = json.load(jsonfile)
    print(data)
```
