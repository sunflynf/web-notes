## Advanced Python Concepts

### Iterators and Generators

Iterators help in traversing through sequences, and generators lazily produce values.

```python
# Iterator example
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_iter = iter(my_list)

print(next(my_iter))
print(next(my_iter))

# Generator example
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

for count in countdown(5):
    print(count)
```

### Decorators

Decorators modify the behavior of functions without changing their code.

```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function call")
        func()
        print("After the function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### Context Managers

Context managers ensure proper resource management (e.g., opening/closing files).

```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Writing with a context manager.")
```

### Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are used for string pattern matching.

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"
text = "There are 123 apples"

match = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(match)  # Output: ['123']
```
