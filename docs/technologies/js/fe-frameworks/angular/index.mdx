# Angular

Angular is a powerful framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications. This guideline covers best practices, tips, and a step-by-step roadmap to help you master Angular development.

## The Basics

### Core Concepts

- **Components**: Building blocks of the UI.
- **Templates**: HTML structure for a component.
- **Directives**: Add behavior to templates.
- **Services**: Encapsulate business logic and data fetching.
- **Modules**: Organize the application and enable lazy loading.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Provide and manage instances of services.

### Essential Tools

- **Node.js & npm**: Required for Angular CLI and package management.
- **Angular CLI**: Command-line interface for project scaffolding and management.
- **TypeScript**: Angular's primary language for development.

## Project Setup

### Install Angular CLI

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Create a New Project

```bash
ng new my-angular-app
```

- Select `SCSS` (preferred for styling) during setup.
- Use strict typing for better code quality.

### Run the Project

```bash
ng serve
```

## Application Architecture

### Recommended Project Structure

```txt
src/
  app/
    components/
    services/
    models/
    pipes/
    directives/
    shared/
    modules/
```

### Component Naming

- Use **kebab-case** for selectors: `<app-header>`.
- Use **PascalCase** for filenames: `HeaderComponent`.

### Module Organization

- **Core Module**: Singletons like services, interceptors.
- **Shared Module**: Reusable components, directives, and pipes.
- Feature modules for specific application domains.

## Best Practices

### Components

- Keep components focused: **One task per component.**
- Use `@Input` and `@Output` for parent-child communication.
- Avoid logic in templates; delegate it to the component class.

### Services

- Use services for state management, API calls, and shared logic.
- Follow the **Singleton** pattern.

### Change Detection

- Use **OnPush** strategy for performance optimization when appropriate.
- Leverage `trackBy` in \*ngFor for efficient DOM updates.

### Forms

- Use **Reactive Forms** for complex use cases.
- Use **Template-Driven Forms** for simpler scenarios.

## Styling Guidelines

- Use SCSS with Angular.
- Follow a consistent BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention.
- Use Angular Material for a consistent UI.
- Leverage CSS variables for theming.

## State Management

- For small apps, manage state using services.
- For large applications, consider **NgRx** (Redux for Angular) or other state management libraries.
- Avoid over-complicating state management; use it only when necessary.

## Error Handling and Logging

- Centralize API error handling using **HTTP Interceptors**.
- Use Angular's **ErrorHandler** for global error tracking.
- Implement logging services for debugging and monitoring.

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy load feature modules.
- Preload critical assets using Angular's `PreloadingStrategy`.
- Use `ngx-quicklink` for route preloading.
- Optimize image loading with modern formats like WebP.
- Minimize change detection with `detached` views where necessary.

## Testing

- Use **Karma** and **Jasmine** for unit testing.
- Write tests for:
  - Components
  - Services
  - Directives
- Use **Protractor** or **Cypress** for end-to-end (E2E) testing.

## Deployment

- Use `ng build --prod` to build production-ready code.
- Optimize bundle sizes using:
  - Tree-shaking.
  - Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.
- Host on platforms like Firebase, Netlify, or AWS.
