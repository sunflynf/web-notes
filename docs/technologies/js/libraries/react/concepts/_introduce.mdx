## Creating a React App

### Using a build tool

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) has a rich ecosystem of plugins to support fast refresh, JSX, Babel/SWC, and other common features
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) supports fast refresh, JSX, TypeScript, Flow, and styling out of the box.
- [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) includes built-in support for React features like fast refresh, JSX, TypeScript, and styling.

```bash
npm create vite@latest app-name --template react
# Using TypeScript
npm create vite@latest app-name --template react-ts

# Parcel
npm install --save-dev parcel
# Rsbuild
npx create-rsbuild --template react
```

### Using Full-stack Frameworks

- [Next.js](/docs/technologies/js/fe-frameworks/react/nextjs.md) takes full advantage of Reactâ€™s architecture to enable full-stack React apps.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/installation) emphasizes standard Web APIs and has several ready to deploy templates for various JavaScript runtimes and platforms.
- [Remix](/docs/technologies/js/fe-frameworks/react/remix.md) is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience.
- [Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more using tools like Nitro and Vite.
- [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) is a full stack React framework with lots of pre-installed packages and configuration that makes it easy to build full-stack web applications.

```bash
# Next
npx create-next-app@latest
# React Router
npx create-react-router@latest
```

## Render

```html title="public/index.html"
<body>
  <!-- Your code will put inside root (or any id) div -->
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
```

```jsx title="src/index.jsx"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<p>Hello</p>);
```
