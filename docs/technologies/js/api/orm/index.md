## Notes

- **[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)**: A mature ORM with wide database support and robust features like transactions and migrations. Best for projects prioritizing stability and broad compatibility.
- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**: A modern ORM with a focus on type safety and developer experience, using a unique schema-based approach. Ideal for TypeScript projects but less flexible for raw SQL.
- **[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)**: Offers flexibility with both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns, strong TypeScript support via decorators. Suited for complex applications but may have maintenance inconsistencies.
- **[Objection.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)**: Built on Knex.js, it excels in complex SQL queries and relational data handling. Best for developers comfortable with SQL who need a lightweight ORM.
- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)**: A lightweight, SQL-first ORM with schema defined in TypeScript code, offering high performance and serverless compatibility. Ideal for developers who prefer SQL control and minimal abstraction, but requires SQL familiarity and careful schema management.
