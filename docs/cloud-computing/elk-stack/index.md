# ELK Stack

## **What is ELK Stack?**

The **ELK stack** is a combination of three open-source tools commonly used for log analysis and searching large volumes of data:

- **Elasticsearch**: A search and analytics engine.
- **Logstash**: A data processing pipeline that ingests data from various sources and sends it to Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana**: A visualization tool that lets you explore data stored in Elasticsearch.

## **ELK on Cloud Platforms**

While the ELK stack can be installed and run on your own on-premise servers, it’s often deployed on cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) because:

- Cloud infrastructure offers scalability, reliability, and managed services.
- AWS, for example, offers a managed ELK service called **Amazon OpenSearch Service** (which is based on Elasticsearch).

## **Key Point**

- **ELK stack is a data processing and analysis stack.**
- **It can run on any infrastructure — on-premises, virtual machines, containers, or cloud platforms — but is not itself a cloud platform.**
