# API Versioning

| Type of Versioning | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **URL Versioning** | Includes the version number in the URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1/resource`). | - Easy to understand and implement. <br/> - Clear and explicit versioning. <br/> - Easy to cache. | - Makes URLs longer and more complex. <br/> - Requires clients to change URLs when upgrading to a new version. <br/> - Can lead to URL pollution. |
| **Request Parameter Versioning** | Includes the version number as a query parameter (e.g., `https://api.example.com/resource?version=1`). | - Keeps the base URL clean. <br/> - Allows for easy switching between versions. <br/> - Easy to implement. | - Can make caching more difficult. <br/> - May not be RESTful. <br/> - Version parameter can be easily overlooked or manipulated. |
| **Header Versioning** | Includes the version number in the HTTP header (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.com.v1+json`). | - Keeps the URL clean. <br/> - Allows for more flexible versioning. <br/> - Can be used to negotiate content based on client capabilities. | - More difficult to implement and debug. <br/> - Requires clients to set the correct headers. <br/> - Can be less explicit than URL versioning. |
| **Media Type Versioning (Mime Type)** | Uses custom media types to version APIs (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.com.v1+json`). | - Very flexible and allows for fine-grained versioning. <br/> - Can be used to negotiate content based on client capabilities. <br/> - Keeps the URL clean. | - Complex to implement. <br/> - Not widely used or understood. <br/> - Can be less explicit than URL versioning. |
| **Server-Driven Content Negotiation** | The server decides which version of the API to use based on the client's capabilities and preferences. | - Very flexible and client-friendly. <br/> - Allows for automatic versioning based on client capabilities. <br/> - Keeps the URL clean. | - Requires more server-side logic. <br/> - Can be difficult to implement and maintain. <br/> - Can make it harder for clients to explicitly request a specific version. |

## Summary

- **URL Versioning** is simple and explicit but can lead to longer URLs.
- **Request Parameter Versioning** keeps the URL clean but can complicate caching.
- **Header Versioning** is flexible but requires more implementation effort.
- **Media Type Versioning** is very flexible but complex to implement.
- **Server-Driven Content Negotiation** is client-friendly but requires more server-side logic.
