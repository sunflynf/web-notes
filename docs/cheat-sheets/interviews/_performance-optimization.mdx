| **Debouncing and Throttling**       | Techniques used to control the rate at which functions are executed. **Debouncing** limits calls to once after a delay; **throttling** limits the number of times a function runs over time. | Debouncing a search input field to avoid excessive API calls while typing.                                                      |
| **Browser Rendering Optimization**  | Techniques to enhance the efficiency of browser rendering, such as reducing reflows and repaints, and minimizing layout shifts, for a smoother user experience.                              | Minimizing use of CSS properties like `position: absolute;` and using `transform` for animations reduces layout recalculations. |
| **Bundle Analysis**                 | Analyzing the content of JavaScript bundles to identify large or unused code that can be optimized for better performance.                                                                   | Using Webpack Bundle Analyzer to see what files and libraries contribute most to bundle size.                                   |
| **Tree Shaking**                    | A technique used in JavaScript bundlers (like Webpack) to remove unused code, making the final bundle smaller and faster to load.                                                            | Importing only specific functions from libraries, like `import { map } from 'lodash-es';`, instead of the entire library.       |

| **Edge Computing**                  | A computing method that processes data closer to the user’s location (edge of the network) rather than relying on a central data center, reducing latency and improving speed.               | CDNs are a type of edge computing that serve content from servers closer to users.                                              |
| **Time to Interactive (TTI)**       | The time it takes for a page to become fully interactive (i.e., when the user can click or scroll without issues), a key metric in performance optimization.                                 | Minimizing JavaScript execution time and using lazy loading helps reduce TTI.                                                   |
