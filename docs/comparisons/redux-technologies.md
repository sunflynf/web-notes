# Redux Middlewares

## Redux Thunk

Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you write action creators that return functions instead of plain action objects. It is essentially a lightweight solution for handling simple asynchronous tasks, often used with `fetch` or `axios` to make API calls.

## Redux Saga

Redux Saga is a middleware that uses generator functions to manage side effects in Redux, particularly complex async flows. It operates on the concept of “sagas,” which are like background processes running parallel to your application, managing effects and timing.

## Redux Query

Redux Query (like RTK Query, which is often recommended) is a library specifically designed for data fetching and caching in Redux applications. It manages data fetching, caching, and updating Redux state without requiring custom middleware or a large amount of boilerplate.

## Sample applications

- **To-Do List**: **Redux Query (RTK Query)** for simplicity and caching. **Redux Thunk** as an alternative for straightforward async handling.
- **Task Management**: **Redux Saga** for complex workflows and real-time interactions. **Redux Query** if focused mainly on CRUD data fetching.
- **Product Management**: **Redux Saga** for advanced business logic and workflows, especially if updates are complex and interconnected.
- **Booking System**: **Redux Saga** for complex workflows (availability checks, payments, real-time needs). **Redux Query** if primarily concerned with data fetching and caching.

### General Guidelines

If your app’s main challenge is data fetching and state management without much interdependency, **Redux Query (RTK Query)** can simplify a lot of boilerplate. For projects with complex workflows, **Redux Saga** will offer the control and flexibility you need to handle these flows reliably. **Redux Thunk** works best in simpler cases or if you already have a strong preference for a lightweight solution.

## Summary

- [**Redux thunk**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk): Use for _simple async tasks or small projects_ where you don’t need complex workflows or data caching.
- [**Redux Saga**](https://redux-saga.js.org/): Best for complex workflows, parallel tasks, and intricate business logic that require _high control_.
- [**Redux Query**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/queries): Ideal for data-heavy applications where caching, efficient data fetching, and automated state updates are priorities.
