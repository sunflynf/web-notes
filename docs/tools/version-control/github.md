# Github

GitHub is **a cloud-based platform** where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:

- Showcase or share your work.
- Track and manage changes to your code over time.
- Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
- Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.
