# Install SDKMAN on Windows

This is hands-down the cleanest way to get SDKMAN! on Windows. Here's how to do it:

{/* truncate */}

> ‚úÖ Recommended Way: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## **Step 1: Install WSL (if you haven't already)**

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

   > This installs WSL with the default Ubuntu distro.

2. Restart your computer when prompted.

3. Launch **Ubuntu** from the Start menu and let it finish setup.

## **Step 2: Install SDKMAN! inside Ubuntu (WSL)**

Once you're inside the Ubuntu terminal:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y zip unzip curl
   ```

2. Install SDKMAN!:

   ```bash
   curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
   ```

3. Activate SDKMAN!:

   ```bash
   source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
   ```

4. Confirm it works:

   ```bash
   sdk version
   ```

> You should see something like `SDKMAN x.y.z installed`.

## **Step 3: Use SDKMAN! to install stuff**

Now you can use commands like:

```bash
sdk list java
sdk install java 17-tem
```

## ‚ùå Native Windows (Not Recommended)

There‚Äôs no official support for native Windows (CMD or PowerShell), and while there are hacky workarounds using Git Bash or Cygwin, they tend to break easily and aren't worth the maintenance headache.

If you really want Java version management natively on Windows, you're better off using tools like:

- **[jEnv](https://www.jenv.be/)** (with workarounds)
- **[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)** (PowerShell-based package manager for Windows)
- **[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)** (if you set up a Unix-like environment)

---

## TL;DR

- ‚úÖ Use **WSL + Ubuntu** ‚Üí install SDKMAN there.
- ‚ùå Don't try to run SDKMAN! directly on native Windows.
- üëå Use `scoop` or `asdf` if you want alternatives natively.
