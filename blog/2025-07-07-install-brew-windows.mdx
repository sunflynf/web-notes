# Install Brew on Windows

This is hands-down the cleanest way to get Brew on Windows.

> ✅ Recommended: Install Homebrew via WSL (Ubuntu)

## **Step 1: Make sure WSL is installed**

If you haven't installed WSL yet:

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

2. Reboot your PC if needed.
3. Launch **Ubuntu** from your Start menu and finish the setup.

## **Step 2: Install Homebrew inside WSL**

Once you're inside the Ubuntu terminal, run the following:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

During install, it might ask you to install some dependencies. Just follow the prompts.

## **Step 3: Add Homebrew to your shell profile**

After installation, you need to add Homebrew to your shell path.

Run:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

If you use Zsh instead of Bash:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

## **Step 4: Confirm it works**

```bash
brew --version
```

You should see something like:

```bash
Homebrew 4.x.x
```

Now you’re good to start installing packages with `brew install ...` just like on macOS.

## ❌ Native Windows? Nope.

Homebrew **doesn't run natively on Windows** — not even with Git Bash or Cygwin — and it’s not worth trying to force it. Use WSL.

If you really need a native Windows package manager, try:

- 🧊 **[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)** – lightweight and works via PowerShell
- 🍫 **[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)** – great for system-level installs

## TL;DR

| Method         | Works? | Notes                           |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| WSL (Ubuntu)   | ✅     | Official, supported             |
| Native Windows | ❌     | Not supported                   |
| Alternative    | ✅     | Use **Scoop** or **Chocolatey** |
